<h3>High School</h3>
<p>Back in high school, I was in a few different clubs/organizations in the two high schools that I went to. The first high school that I went to was Lake Park High School(LPHS), which I went to for my Freshman and Sophomore year. At LPHS, I was in the choir and I was in their freshman student council.</p>
<p>The second high school that I went to was Hinsdale Central High School (HCHS). In HCHS, I was in Girls Track and Field for my junior year. During my senior year, I was part of the "Invitation to Teach" program, which allowed me to intern to be a teacher for a variety of different grades. </p>
