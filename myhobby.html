<h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
<h2><u>Soccer</u></h2>
<article>
<p>One of my hobbies is watching and playing soccer. Whenever I'm with my younger cousins, especially when in the summer, we play soccer in their backyard. One of my favorite teams for soccer is Real Madrid. A lot of my family likes to keep track of a lot of the games that are currently on, especially during the World Cup. During World Cup, my entire family roots for Poland to win. Even though, for the past couple of years, Poland has not gotten too far in the World Cup.  </p>
