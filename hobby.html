<dt><strong>Puzzles</strong></dt>
    <dd>During my free time, when I'm not working or in school, I like doing jigsaw puzzles.</dd>
<dt><strong>Soccer</strong></dt>
    <dd>One of my other hobbies is playing and watching soccer. During my free time, my cousins and I always end up playing soccer in their back yard. One of my favorite teams for soccer is Real Madrid. During World Cup, my family and I keep track of all the games and make sure that we record each match so that we can watch it later that day. One of the countries that my family roots for during World Cup is Poland, even though Poland hasn't gotten too far in the tournement in the last couple years.</dd>
